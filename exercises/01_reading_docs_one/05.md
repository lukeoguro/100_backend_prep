# Exercise 5

The documentation for numbers can be found [here](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Numbers).
The documentation states that underscores can be used to enhance readability for humans.
Underscores can be placed anywhere.
For example, the following integers are equal to each other.

```ruby
1234
1_234
```
