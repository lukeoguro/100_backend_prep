# Exercise 2

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

The code still prints `7`, because method definitions are self-contained with respect to local variables.
Therefore, the top-level `a` is not visible from within the method definition, and variable `a` from the method definition is a local variable with no top-level visibility.
