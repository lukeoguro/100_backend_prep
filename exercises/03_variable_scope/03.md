# Exercise 3

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(b)
  a = b
end

my_value(a + 5)
puts a
```

The code prints `7`.
While deceptive, calling `a = b` from within the method definition creates a new local variable with no top-level visibility, because top-level `a` is not visible from within the method definition.
Therefore, the top-level `a` remains untouched.
