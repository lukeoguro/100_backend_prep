# Exercise 4

```ruby
a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b[2] = '-'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

The code prints `Xy-zy`, because `String#[]=` is a mutating method.
The documentation for this can be found [here](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/String.html#method-i-5B-5D-3D).
Since `b[2] = '-'` modifies the string referenced by variable `b`, and `b` references the same string as `a`, variable `a` is mutated.
