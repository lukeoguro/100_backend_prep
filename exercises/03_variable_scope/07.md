# Exercise 7

```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a
```

The code outputs `3`.
When there is a method invocation with a block (which in our code, is done with `Array#each`), the inner scope can access variables on the other scope, but not vice versa.
Therefore, `a = element` can access the top-level `a`, and the final assignment is `3`, the last element of the array.
