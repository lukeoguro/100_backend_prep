# Exercise 8

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a
```

The code outputs an error, because variable `a` was never initialized in the other scope.
When there is a method invocation with a block, the inner scope can access variables on the outer scope, but not vice versa.
Therefore, `a = element` repeatedly initializes variable `a` in the inner scope (that cannot be referenced in the outer scope).
