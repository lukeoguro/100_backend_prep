# Exercise 9

```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |a|
  a += 1
end

puts a
```

The code prints `7`, because `a` within the block is shadowing the outer `a`.
To change the outer `a`, we would define `a` within the block as something else, like `b`.
It is important to note that `a += 1` doesn't modify the array either, because `a += 1` is shorthand for `a = a + 1` and the assignment operator doesn't mutate the caller.
If instead this were an array of strings, and we used `String#<<` instead, the array would be mutated.
