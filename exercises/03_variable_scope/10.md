# Exercise 10

```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

def my_value(ary)
  ary.each do |b|
    a += b
  end
end

my_value(array)
puts a
```

The code outputs an error.
The outer `a` is not visible to the invocation of the `each` method with a block, because the invocation of `each` is within `my_value`, and method definitions are self-contained with respect to local variables.
If the code were `a = b` instead, there would be no error.
However, since `a += b` is shorthand for `a = a + b` and `a` was never assigned locally, an error is returned.
