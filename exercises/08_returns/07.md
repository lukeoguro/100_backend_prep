# Exercise 7

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
end

puts count_sheep
```

The code prints:

```ruby
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

0 to 4 are printed from the `#times` method.
The last output, 5, is from `puts count_sheep`.
Since the `#times` method is the last line called in the `count_sheep` method definition and the `#times` method returns `self` (which in our case is 5), 5 is printed at the very end.
