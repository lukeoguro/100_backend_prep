# Exercise 9

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
    if sheep >= 2
      return
    end
  end
end

p count_sheep
```

The code prints:

```ruby
0
1
2
nil
```

0 to 2 are printed from the `#times` method, but the method is `returned` immediately after.
Since nothing is returned, `nil` is printed.
