# Exercise 1

```ruby
def find_first_nonzero_among(numbers)
  numbers.each do |n|
    return n if n.nonzero?
  end
end

# Examples

find_first_nonzero_among(0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0)
find_first_nonzero_among(1)
```

The code produces the error:

```shell
01.rb:1:in `find_first_nonzero_among': wrong number of arguments (given 6, expected 1) (ArgumentError)
        from 01.rb:9:in `<main>'
```

This means that the `find_first_nonzero_among` method invocation on line 9 raises an `ArgumentError` on line 1.
The error is raised because there were were 6 arguments passed when there is only 1 parameter.
This error is relieved with the following code.

```ruby
find_first_nonzero_among([0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0])
```

However, there is another error in the code.

```shell
01.rb:2:in `find_first_nonzero_among': undefined method `each' for 1:Integer (NoMethodError)
        from 01.rb:10:in `<main>'
```

This time, the method invocation from line 10 raises an `NoMethodError` on line 2.
This occurs because the `#each` method cannot be called on an integer.
This is resolved with:

```ruby
find_first_nonzero_among([1])
```
