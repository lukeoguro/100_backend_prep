# Exercise 7

```shell
SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'
```

The error message is indicating that there is an opening bracket somewhere without a closing bracket.
This could have occurred by erroneously closing a hash with `)` not `}`.
An example is below.

```ruby
new_hash = { name: "John", 
             age: 33 )
```
