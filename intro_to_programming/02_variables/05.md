# Exercise 5

```ruby
x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x
```

The code above prints `3`.
This is because the inner scope can access the `x` variable.

```ruby
y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x
```

The code will output an error, because the outer scope cannot access the `x` variable in the inner scope.
