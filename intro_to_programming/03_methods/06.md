# Exercise 6

```shell
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
```

The error message tells us that the `calculate_product` method called in line 4 is missing a required argument.
The method calls for 2 arguments but only 1 was provided.
