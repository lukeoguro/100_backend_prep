# Exercise 5

```ruby
def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
end

equal_to_four(5)
```

Running the above code produces the error message:

```shell
exercise.rb:8: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end
```

The error occurs because the keyword `end` was expected to close the `equal_to_four` method but interpreter never got it.
This is fixed in the following code.

```ruby
def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
  end
end
equal_to_four(5)
```
