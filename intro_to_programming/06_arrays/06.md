# Exercise 6

```ruby
names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'
```

The code above produces the following error.

```shell
TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
```

The error occurs because a string was used as a key when an integer index was required.
This is fixed in the following code.

```ruby
names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names[names.index('margaret')] = 'jody'
p names
```
