# Exercise 15

```ruby
hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

if hash1 == hash2
  puts "These hashes are the same!"
else
  puts "These hashes are not the same!"
end
```

The code above will output `"These hashes are the same!"` because hashes store values by associating with keys, not order.
